    "about-me-text-1" : "I am currently unable to have my own dog (working full time engineer and part time Johns Hopkins masters student), but I LOVE small dogs, particularly Yorkies! Since I can't commit to having my own dog, I would like to spend some of my free time watching someone else's. If you want to go out for the day and don't want to leave your dog alone, contact me!",
    "about-me-text-2" : "I grew up not only with dogs, but with a dad as a veterinarian. I am responsible and exceptionally careful when it comes to pets. I understand that each owner has a different idea of how a dog should be cared for to maintain its training, account for different personality traits, etc. I also grew up with a very small dog and know the extra attention she required - your dog will be safe with me!",
